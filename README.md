# Courses_Bot
This is a project of a Discord Bot oriented to search for programming courses on the Internet.

I am currently setting up the structure and working on the operation of the Bot.

For the project I am using:
- Python
- Flask
- Discord.py
- Selenium
- Dotenv

In the future I will update this README to continue adding details about the development process of the project.
